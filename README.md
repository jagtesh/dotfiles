# Jag's Dotfiles

This is a collection of my dotfile configuration over the years. I still use vim (or neovim) as an editor for quick edits, and spacemacs or JetBrains * for more heavy duty development.

When I am not developing, I like to read and try out new things. Specifically, I really like following innovations in distributed (and cloud) computing, concurrency and cross-platform development.
